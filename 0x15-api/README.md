# API Data Processing Project

This project is a comprehensive exploration of working with APIs and data manipulation using Python scripting. It involves several tasks that build upon each other, requiring the use of REST APIs, CSV, and JSON formats.

## Project Overview

The tasks in this project are designed to enhance your understanding of API usage, data extraction, and manipulation. The tasks include:

1. **Task 0: Gather data from an API**
   - Create a Python script to fetch data from a given REST API endpoint.
   - Accepts an employee ID as a parameter and displays the TODO list progress.
  
2. **Task 1: Export to CSV**
   - Extend the Python script from Task 0 to export retrieved data in CSV format.
   - Records tasks owned by the employee and stores them in a CSV file (USER_ID.csv).

3. **Task 2: Export to JSON**
   - Further extend the Python script to export data in JSON format.
   - Records tasks owned by the employee and organizes the data in a specific JSON format (USER_ID.json).

4. **Task 3: Dictionary of list of dictionaries**
   - Extend the Python script to handle tasks from all employees.
   - Organize the data in a nested dictionary structure and store it in a file (todo_all_employees.json).

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Gain practical experience in working with REST APIs.
- Learn to manipulate data in different formats (CSV, JSON) using Python.
- Understand the importance of clean and readable code.
- Familiarize yourself with best practices such as adhering to PEP8 style guidelines and creating meaningful documentation.

## Project Structure

- **Task 0 Script**: Contains the Python script for fetching data from the API and displaying TODO list progress.
- **Task 1 Script**: Extension of Task 0, exports data to CSV format.
- **Task 2 Script**: Extension of Task 0, exports data to JSON format.
- **Task 3 Script**: Extension of Task 0, handles tasks from all employees and stores data in a nested dictionary structure.
- **README.md**: Project overview, objectives, and instructions.

## Usage

1. **Task 0: Gather data from an API**
   - Run the script with the employee ID as a parameter to see the TODO list progress.
   ```
   python task0_script.py EMPLOYEE_ID
   ```

2. **Task 1: Export to CSV**
   - Run the script to export data to CSV format.
   ```
   python task1_script.py EMPLOYEE_ID
   ```

3. **Task 2: Export to JSON**
   - Run the script to export data to JSON format.
   ```
   python task2_script.py EMPLOYEE_ID
   ```

4. **Task 3: Dictionary of list of dictionaries**
   - Run the script to handle tasks from all employees and store data in JSON format.
   ```
   python task3_script.py
   ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5
- Libraries: urllib or requests, pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)

## Notes

- Ensure that all scripts have the necessary permissions to execute.
- Follow PEP8 guidelines for code style and organization.
- Do not publish any content of this project to maintain confidentiality and integrity.

**Note:** Plagiarism or any form of dishonesty is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
